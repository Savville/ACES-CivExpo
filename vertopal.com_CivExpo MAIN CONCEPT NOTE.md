# **PROJECT CONCEPT NOTE: ACES CivExpo 2026**

**Theme:** *Building Kenya's Tomorrow: Sustainable Infrastructure for a
Resilient Future*\
**Host:** ACES (Association of Civil Engineering Students) -- Kenyatta
University Chapter

**Date:** May 2026 (Tentative)

**Venue:** Kenyatta University

## **1. Executive Summary**

The **ACES CivExpo 2026** is the premier student-industry interface for
the built environment in Kenya. Moving beyond theoretical coursework,
CivExpo challenges students to solve real-world engineering problems
using modern digital tools and sustainable practices.

This year, we are bridging the gap between **established industry
giants** and **agile, tech-driven startups**. Our goal is to simulate a
complete project lifecycle---from design and material specification to
risk management and execution---creating a talent pipeline that is ready
for the future of Kenyan infrastructure.

## **2. Summary of Programmes**

The CivExpo is not just a single event but a structured season of
learning, innovation, and competition.

-   **Phase 1: The Launch & Masterclasses (Weeks 1-2)**

    -   Virtual rollout of the Technical Briefs.

    -   **Industry Skills Workshops:** Partner-led sessions on
        > specialized topics (e.g., *\"BIM with ADCC\"*, *\"Sustainable
        > Concrete with Sika\"*).

    -   Software bootcamps (Revit, EPANET, Civil 3D).

-   **Phase 2: The Design Challenge (Weeks 3-6)**

    -   Teams work remotely on their chosen category.

    -   **\"Office Hours\":** Weekly mentorship slots where students can
        > ask industry partners technical questions.

    -   Submission of Concept Reports and Digital Models.

-   **Phase 3: The Grand Finale (Expo Day)**

    -   **Project Exhibition:** Top teams present their designs to
        > judges.

    -   **Corporate Booths:** Partners exhibit products and recruit
        > talent.

    -   **Panel Discussions:** Leaders from KeNHA, KURA, and Private
        > Sector discuss *Resilience in Infrastructure*.

    -   **Awards Ceremony:** Crowning the winners of the 2026 Challenge.

## **3. The Competition Challenge Structure**

The core of CivExpo 2026 revolves around three technical competitions
designed to mirror actual challenges facing Kenya's infrastructure
sector.

### **Category A: Structures -- *The Hillside Hostel Challenge***

**Theme:** *Adapting to Terrain: Affordable & Resilient Housing on
Challenging Sites.*

-   **The Task:** Design a conceptually complete multi-storey student
    > hostel for **1,000 students** on a steep, hypothetical 1-acre
    > urban site (approx. 10% slope).

-   **Key Constraints:**

    -   **Topography:** Must step the foundation to minimize excavation
        > (Cut/Fill balance).

    -   **Materials:** Prioritize low-carbon options (e.g., ISSB, Green
        > Concrete).

    -   **Livability:** Maximize natural ventilation and accessibility
        > despite the slope.

### **Category B: Water Resources -- *The \"Zero-Day\" Campus System***

**Theme:** *Every Drop Counts: Engineering Resilience Against Scarcity.*

-   **The Task:** Design an integrated water supply, harvesting,
    > treatment, and reuse system for a campus of **10,000 students**
    > facing chronic shortages.

-   **Key Constraints:**

    -   **Scarcity:** System must survive with municipal water available
        > only 3 days/week.

    -   **Circular Economy:** \"Purple Pipe\" system mandatory for
        > reusing wastewater in irrigation/flushing.

    -   **Hydraulics:** Gravity-fed design using EPANET modeling.

### **Category C: Transport -- *The \"Last Mile\" Mobility Corridor***

**Theme:** *Beyond the Potholes: Designing for People, Not Just Cars.*

-   **The Task:** Upgrade a **3km steep gravel access road** and
    > internal campus mobility loop to all-weather standards.

-   **Key Constraints:**

    -   **NMT Focus:** ≥60% of space dedicated to Non-Motorized
        > Transport (Walkways/Cycle tracks).

    -   **Terrain:** 75m elevation gain with a river crossing (requires
        > bridge/culvert design).

    -   **Resilience:** Drainage design for 1-in-10-year flood events.

## **6. Value Proposition for Partners**

Why partner with ACES CivExpo 2026?

-   **Early Talent Acquisition:** Access to the top 10% of engineering
    > students who are demonstrating practical skills (Revit, EPANET,
    > Civil 3D) rather than just theory.

-   **Brand Positioning:** Embed your products and standards (e.g., Sika
    > specs, Primavera scheduling) into the minds of future engineers
    > before they enter the market.

-   **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Directly support **SDG 9
    > (Innovation & Infrastructure)** and **SDG 4 (Quality Education)**
    > by mentoring the next generation.

-   **Market Intelligence:** For startups like **Jenga App** and
    > **CracksFox**, gain visibility and feedback from a tech-savvy
    > youth demographic.

## **7. Call to Action**

We invite you to join us in **Building Kenya's Tomorrow**. Whether as a
Title Sponsor, a Technical Mentor, or an Exhibitor, your contribution
will shape the resilience of our future infrastructure.
